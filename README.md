# Mother Project Introduction

🚧 **Project Overview**

The Project was born out of the realization that Civil Engineering students lacked essential tools for their Project-Based Learning in college. Then we want to develop IT tools tailored to the needs of these students, empowering them to enhance the quality of their projects.

🏗️ **Programming in Construction Optimization**

We aim to revolutionize the field by introducing programming to optimize construction processes. Utilizing technology and coding, we seek to improve project outcomes in the field of Civil Engineering.

# Beam Section Plugin #01

🏢 **Project Description**

Beam Section Plugin #01 is our initial foray into this exciting journey. This small-scale project addresses the need for a more efficient way to deploy Concrete Beam Sections on Technical Drawings. We use the AutoCAD.NET API to draw multiple sections simultaneously.

🕒 **Ongoing Development**

This project is in its early stages and has been developed over a span of just 2 weeks. We acknowledge that there is room for improvement, and we are committed to enhancing its capabilities in future versions.
